Code for paper: EEG-based seizure prediction via hybrid vision transformer and data uncertainty learning

## About the paper
* Title: [EEG-based seizure prediction via hybrid vision transformer and data uncertainty learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197623005857)
* Authors: Zhiwei Deng, Chang Li, Rencheng Song, Xiang Liu, Ruobing Qian, Xun Chen
* Institution: Hefei University of Technology
* Published in: Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence
## Instructions
* Before running the code, please download the CHB-MIT and Kaggle dataset, unzip them and place them into the right directory. You can modify the path of the CHBMIT and Kaggle dataset directory in the_SETTINGS_CHBMIT.json_:"datadir" and _SETTINGS_Kaggle.json_:"datadir", respectively.
* "cachedir" is the path to save .hickle files. Each .hickle data file contains the EEG signals and consponding labels of a subject. There are 2 arrays in the file: **data** 
and **labels**. The shape of **data** for CHB-MIT is (128, 1, 1280, 22). The shape of **label** is (128,). 
* leave one out cross-validation is used.
* The CHB-MIT dataset can be found [here](https://physionet.org/content/chbmit/1.0.0/).
* The Kaggle dataset can be found [here]( https://www.kaggle.com/c/seizure-prediction/data).
